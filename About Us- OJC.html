<body>
We are a International Broadcasting Company with 3 channels so far; CIBC (children's IBC), IBC (more for adults and teens), and IBC2,
(our second IBC for adults and teens with a different comfort zone.) All these channels will start to be broadcasted everday,
with CIBC hoping to broadcast from 7pm-9pm!
